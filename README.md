## ServerlessDocs
ServerlessDocs is a Serverless Document Management System I created to showcase the usage of different AWS Services like Cognito, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, etc. 

## Docs
[Still In Progress] Please refer to the full documentation [here](https://dhaval-b-nagar.gitbook.io/serverless-cognito-s3). 

## AWS Services used
- Amazon Cognito (User Pool and Identity Pool)
- AWS Lambda (For Cognito Hooks)
- Amazon S3 (To Host the Frontend and Store Files)
- Amazon Pinpoint (To send outbound emails)
- AWS API Gateway (For Google Sign-In Tokens)
- AWS IAM (Roles, Permissions, etc)

## Caveats
- MFA is by enabled by default, required to configure after the first login.
- Google Sign-In is optional and by default disabled, will share more detail in the docs.
- Documentation is still work in progress.

# Deployment 
The app currently has two deployment setups, 1) Serverless Framework and 2) SAM. The serverless framework is already pushed in the repo and SAM will be pushed soon.

## ServerlessDocs Backend - Serverless Framework
`serverless-docs-backend` folder contains the Serverless backend code and configurations. 

Deploy the backend with `sls deploy --stage ` and use the output variables in `serverless-docs-frontend/app-config.js` file.
